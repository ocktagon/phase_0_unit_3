### Reflection

What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?

Dealing with the bug to create an account in SQL zoo ended up taking longer for me than doing the exercises.  Once I got up and running, it became easier.  

What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I took a pretty straightforward approach of googling the command, space, followed by sql every time i encountered an unfamiliar topic.  

What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out?
I'm pretty comfortable with select in select, aggregation, and joins; but having trouble combining the concepts as the commands get more complicated.  

Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
the select command syntax was very straightforward to follow.  I'm very happy to learn many ways to manipulate databases.

How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
Not extremely confident.  With limited time during the last 2 weeks, I'm struggling to get through the curriculum and sometimes skipping the bonuses. 

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
Enjoyed learning ins and outs of sql

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Set up and looking through multiple online sources.  Wish program had something I can look at locally in my desktop, regardless of whether wifi/internet connection was available.
