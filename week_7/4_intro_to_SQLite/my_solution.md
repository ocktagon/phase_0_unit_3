Learning basic commands on sqlite was easy after learning sql commands early on.  As for syntax, it's really hard to memorize all of this so I'm having trouble with that.  

I am worried that I don't yet know how to manipulate
big data dumps, and would like to learn that sooner than later as that would be a common task when using sqlite.
